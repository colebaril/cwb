\arguments{
\item{path}{Character. The base directory to start searching from.}

\item{ext}{Character vector or NULL. File extensions to include (e.g., c("xls", "xlsx", "xlsm")). Case-insensitive. Default is NULL (all extensions).}

\item{include}{Character vector or NULL. Patterns that must be present in the file path. Multiple patterns are AND-ed, i.e., all patterns must match. Can include regex expressions. Default is NULL (no include filtering).}

\item{exclude}{Character vector or NULL. Patterns that must NOT be present in the file path. Multiple patterns are OR-ed, i.e., files matching any exclude pattern are removed. Can include regex expressions. Default is NULL (no exclusion filtering).}

\item{recursive}{Logical. Should the search include subfolders? Default is TRUE.}

\item{return_list}{Logical. Whether a list is returned instead of a tibble. Default FALSE.}
